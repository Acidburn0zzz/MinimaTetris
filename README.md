# MinimaTetris ?

Last night, it was hard for me to sleep, so I created this little Tetris. It's not finished yet, and I'll update it later with an Artificial Intelligence.

## Install:

```
$> sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
$> git clone https://github.com/JeremyPouyet/MinimaTetris.git
$> cd MinimaTetris/ && make
$> ./MinimaTetris
```
